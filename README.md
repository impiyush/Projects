# Projects

This repository contains some personal projects I have worked on

- [Predicting College Admissions](./Predicting_College_Admissions)

    Use test scores to predict total number of admissions in a college

- [Recognize US Bills](./Recognize_US_Bills)

    Use transfer learning to create a convolutional model to recognize a US Dollar bill. There is also a simple flask web app as a front end to get predictions from the trained model parameters.
